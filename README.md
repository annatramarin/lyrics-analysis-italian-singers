# lyrics_analysis_italian_singers
Lyrics analysis and comparison of three Italian singers - Fabrizio De Andr√©, Giorgio Gaber and Francesco Guccini.

The following steps were taken:
- the song lyrics were web-scraped 
- identification of the most frequent words in the singers' corpora 
- calculation of Spearman correlation between the three singers - before and after stopword removal
- weirdness index: how "typical" is a word in a songwriter's lyrics production?
